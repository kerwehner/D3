## Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler (Required Assignment)

Using D3, data was pulled in from the `data.csv` and two variables `Healthcare vs. Poverty` were used to create a scatter plot. The following was also completed:

* State abbreviations were included as text labels in the circles.
* Axes and labels were created and situated to the left and bottom of the chart.

## Bonus: Impress the Boss (Optional Assignment)

#### 1. More Data, More Dynamics

For the bonus, more demographics and more risk factors were included on the chart by doing the following:

* Binding all of the CSV data to the circles to easily determine their x or y values when the labels are clicked.
* Placing additional labels in the scatter plot and giving them click events so that users can decide which data to display.
* Animating the transitions for circles' locations as well as the range of the axes.
